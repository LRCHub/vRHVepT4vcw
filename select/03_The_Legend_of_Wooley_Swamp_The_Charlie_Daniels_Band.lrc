[00:18.63] Well, if you ever go back in the Wooley Swamp
[00:21.22] Well, you better not go at night
[00:23.64] There's things out there in the middle of them woods
[00:25.70] That make a strong man die from fright
[00:44.70] 
[00:28.58] Things that crawl and things that fly
[00:30.77] And things that creep around on the ground
[00:32.82] And they say the ghost of Lucius Clay
[00:35.23] Gets up and he walks around
[00:48.73] 
[00:37.23] But I couldn't believe it
[00:40.01] I just had to find out for myself
[00:42.29] And I couldn't conceive it
[00:44.11] 'Cause I never would have listened to nobody else
[01:08.61] 
[00:47.23] And I couldn't believe it
[00:49.87] I just had to find out for myself
[00:52.65] There's some things in this world
[00:54.52] You just can't explain
[01:05.52] 
[01:00.12] The old man lived in the Wooley Swamp
[01:02.18] Way back in Booger Woods
[01:04.69] He never did do a lot of harm in the world
[01:06.81] But he never did do no good
[01:09.53] People didn't think too much of him
[01:11.46] They all thought he acted funny
[01:13.47] The old man didn't care about people anyway
[01:16.10] All he cared about was his money
[01:32.10] 
[01:18.32] He'd stuff it all down into mason jars
[01:20.68] And he'd bury it all around
[01:22.88] And on certain nights if the moon was right
[01:25.46] He'd dig it up out of the ground
[01:27.73] He'd pour it all out on the floor of his shack
[01:30.23] And run his fingers through it
[01:32.24] Yeah, Lucius Clay was a greedy old man
[01:34.87] And that's all that there was to it
[01:52.37] 
[01:41.45] But I couldn't believe it
[01:43.99] I just had to find out for myself
[01:45.98] And I couldn't conceive it
[01:48.63] 'Cause I never would have listened to nobody else
[02:13.13] 
[01:51.06] And I couldn't believe it
[01:53.60] I just had to find out for myself
[01:56.47] But there's some things in this world
[01:58.38] You just can't explain
[02:09.38] 
[02:03.91] The Cable boys was white trash
[02:06.07] They lived over on Carver's Creek
[02:08.40] They were mean as a snake and sneaky as a cat
[02:11.15] And belligerent when they'd speak
[02:13.04] One night the oldest brother said
[02:15.25] "Y'all meet me at the Wooley Swamp later
[02:17.77] And we'll take old Lucius's money
[02:19.57] And we'll feed him to the alligators"
[02:38.07] 
[02:22.44] They found the old man out in the back
[02:24.77] With a shovel in his hand
[02:27.17] Thirteen rusty mason jars
[02:29.28] Was just dug up out of the sand
[02:31.64] And they all went crazy, and they beat the old man
[02:34.13] And then they picked him up off of the ground
[02:36.48] Threw him in the swamp and stood there and laughed
[02:38.87] As the black water sucked him down
[02:55.87] 
[02:40.83] Then they turned around and went back to the shack
[02:43.77] Picked up the money and ran
[02:45.32] They hadn't gone no where when they realized
[02:47.96] They were running in quicksand
[02:50.10] And they struggled and they screamed
[02:51.87] But they couldn't get away, and just before they went under
[02:54.83] They could hear that old man laughing
[02:57.26] In a voice as loud as thunder
[03:11.76] 
[02:59.96] And that's been fifty years ago
[03:02.61] And you can go by there yet
[03:04.59] There's a spot in the yard in the back of that shack
[03:06.93] Where the ground is always wet
[03:09.12] And on summer nights, if the moon is right
[03:11.97] Down by the that dark footpath
[03:14.02] You can hear three young men screaming
[03:16.33] You can hear one old man laugh
[03:31.33] 
[03:18.54] Ever go back into Wooley Swamp
[03:20.63] Well, you better not go at night
[03:23.29] There's things out there in the middle of them woods
[03:25.49] That make a strong man die from fright
[03:44.49] 
[03:28.19] Things that crawl and things that fly
[03:30.36] And things that creep around on the ground
[03:32.46] And they say the ghost of Lucius Clay
[03:34.83] Gets up, and he walks around
[03:48.83] 
[03:36.84] But I couldn't believe it
[03:39.44] I just had to find out for myself
[03:41.72] And I couldn't conceive it
[03:44.17] 'Cause I never would've listened to nobody else
[04:07.67] 
[03:46.58] And I couldn't believe it
[03:49.30] I just had to find out for myself
[03:52.14] There's some things in this world
[03:53.90] You just can't explain
[04:04.90] 
[03:57.17] There's some things in this world
[03:58.66] You just can't explain
